{"concludeQuestions":{"support":"No","confidence":"Moderately confident in my conclusion","improve":"Assuming the x-axis (Moisture %) indicates saturation at 100% moisture, this experimental setup only shows a small proportion of moisture content relative to shear strength. I would want to see more data points for higher moisture content. I think the given hypothesis is not correct, as there is variable shear strength below 2% saturation with no discernible trend, and no apparent relationship between increasing moisture content and shear strength between 2 and 12 percent moisture content. I would be interested to identify if there are other factors present that would affect shear strength - grain size, grain shape, and packing may differ substantially along a dune profile and may impact shear strength."},"isAlternativeHypo":true,"form":{"consistent":{"value":"Yes"},"evenly-space":{"value":"Yes"},"consistent-reason":{"value":"Three measurements are enough to get a small sense of variability at each location, but small enough to be efficient with time and sampling effort."},"evenly-space-reason":{"value":"An evenly spaced sampling scheme seemed like the most unbiased way to get a representation of the variability along the dune.
