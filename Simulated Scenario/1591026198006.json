There is also quite a lot of scatter in the data, so it could also be imporoved by increaseing the number of data-points at each location, however, this would depend more on the scope of the field work and time available to undertake the work."},"isAlternativeHypo":false,"form":{"consistent":{"value":"Yes"},"evenly-space":{"value":"Yes"},"consistent-reason":{"value":"I undertook 5 at each location as i felt this would provide an idea on the variability within the results while still maintaining a low enough number to be feasible within a field sampling campaign. "},"evenly-space-reason":{"value":"As part of the hypothesis was how the moisture content varies across the transect, i wanted to understand the transect as well as the relationship between shear stress and moisture content. If the profile of moisture content was known prior to sampling then the collection of data may have varied to enable an even number of sample points at each moisture content as with my method there was a gap in certain moisture percentages.
