To get enough different elevations and dune position, I used a roughly evenly spaced sampling. Plus, it is easy to lay a tape on the ground in the field. Lastly, without prior information about the moisture or shear strength along the dune, a uniform sampling avoids biasing toward a pre-existing hypothesis."},"p1-support":{"value":"Yes"},"p1-confidence":{"value":"Moderately confident in this conclusion"},"p2-support":{"value":"No"},"p2-confidence":{"value":"Moderately confident in this conclusion"},"p3-support":{"value":"Yes"},"p3-confidence":{"value":"Moderately confident in this conclusion"},"p4-support":{"value":"No"},"p4-confidence":{"value":"Very confident in this conclusion"},"age":{"value":"28"},"gender":{"value":"male","reason":""},"if-bachelor":{"value":"Yes"},"years-of-practice":{"value":"16"},"geoscientist-or-psychologist":{"value":"Geoscientist","reason":""},"familiarity":{"value":"I am familiar with some features","reason":"soil moisture, slope stability, eolian transport.
