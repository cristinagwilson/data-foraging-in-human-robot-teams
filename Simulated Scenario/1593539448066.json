There's a clear break in the slope at about 5-6% sand content. I would want to do linear regressions on the (transformed) data around either side of this break point to demonstrate that the slopes of the line below the break point is positive and the slope of the line above the break point is flat. That second test (for flatness) may not yet have enough power, as I'd want very high power B~.9-.95 to confidently confirm acceptance of the null hypothesis."},"isAlternativeHypo":false,"form":{"consistent":{"value":"Yes"},"evenly-space":{"value":"Yes"},"consistent-reason":{"value":"To facilitate ease in statistical/intuative comparisons between sampling locations"},"evenly-space-reason":{"value":"I didn't yet know where key zones of variability in saturation were, so I was looking to identify the overall trends in saturation"},"p1-support":{"value":"Yes"},"p1-confidence":{"value":"Moderately confident in this conclusion"},"p2-support":{"value":"No"},"p2-confidence":{"value":"Slightly confident in this conclusion"},"p3-support":{"value":"Yes"},"p3-confidence":{"value":"Moderately confident in this conclusion"},"p4-support":{"value":"No"},"p4-confidence":{"value":"Moderately confident in this conclusion"},"age":{"value":"35"},"gender":{"value":"male","reason":""},"if-bachelor":{"value":"Yes"},"years-of-practice":{"value":"13"},"geoscientist-or-psychologist":{"value":"Geoscientist","reason":""},"familiarity":{"value":"I am familiar with some features","reason":"concepts of shear strength and sand saturation are moderately familiar to me"},"academia-or-industry":{"value":"Industry","reason":""},"identification":{"value":"Field Geoscientist","reason":""},"geoscience-specialization":{"value":"Fluvial Geomorphology"}},"rows":[{"index":0,"measurements":5,"type":"normal","normOffsetX":248.6048404369244,"normOffsetY":70.40137074319983,"roc":"I don’t have enough information to make a confidence judgment"},{"index":5,"measurements":5,"type":"normal","normOffsetX":405.90790319126154,"normOffsetY":95.70186335403727,"roc":"I don’t have enough information to make a confidence judgment"},{"index":10,"measurements":5,"type":"normal","normOffsetX":563.2109659455987,"normOffsetY":138.60269865067465,"roc":"Slightly confident the data supports the hypothesis"},{"index":15,"measurements":5,"type":"normal","normOffsetX":730.4142214606982,"normOffsetY":215.60419790104947,"roc":"Slightly confident the data supports the hypothesis"},{"index":20,"measurements":5,"type":"discarded","normOffsetX":900.9175412293853,"normOffsetY":281.60548297279934,"roc":null},{"index":13,"measurements":5,"type":"deviate","normOffsetX":661.3878774898266,"normOffsetY":174.90340544013708,"roc":"Slightly confident the data supports the hypothesis"},{"index":17,"measurements":5,"type":"deviate","normOffsetX":807.6907260655387,"normOffsetY":262.90511886913686,"roc":"Slightly confident the data supports the hypothesis"},{"index":12,"measurements":5,"type":"deviate","normOffsetX":619.5870636110516,"normOffsetY":158.4030841721996,"roc":"Slightly confident the data supports the hypothesis"},{"index":19,"measurements":5,"type":"deviate","normOffsetX":857.1916898693511,"normOffsetY":288.2056114799743,"roc":"Moderately confident the data supports the hypothesis"},{"index":8,"measurements":5,"type":"deviate","normOffsetX":497.4846862283144,"normOffsetY":114.40222745769972,"roc":"Moderately confident the data supports the hypothesis"},{"index":11,"measurements":5,"type":"deviate","normOffsetX":605.2867851788392,"normOffsetY":136.40265581494967,"roc":"Very confident the data supports the hypothesis"}]}
