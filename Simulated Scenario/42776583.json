The experimenter explained this to me and then I changed my sampling strategy to 2 per location to get a rough handle on variance.  Ideally you'd do 3 or more to really nail down the variance, but that is a second order problem relative to nailing down the overall trend, which was the first-order problem."},"evenly-space-reason":{"value":"I expected steep gradients in moisture especially at the beginning, and suspected there may be some later as well, so I short spaced the sampling at the crest and interdune interface.  Turns out really just the crest to central stoss slope was needed, but it was all valuable.  The ultimate strategy was actually pretty even as I filled in holes to make sure I was seeing a real trend through the variance in individual samples."},"p1-support":{"value":"Yes"},"p1-confidence":{"value":"Moderately confident in this conclusion"},"p2-support":{"value":"Yes"},"p2-confidence":{"value":"Slightly confident in this conclusion"},"p3-support":{"value":"Yes"},"p3-confidence":{"value":"Very confident in this conclusion"},"p4-support":{"value":"Yes"},"p4-confidence":{"value":"Slightly confident in this conclusion"},"age":{"value":"51"},"gender":{"value":"male","reason":""},"education":{"value":"Professional"},"years-of-practice":{"value":"25"},"geoscientist-or-psychologist":{"value":"Geoscientist","reason":""},"familiarity":{"value":"I am familiar with some features","reason":"I've spent a lot of time in sand dunes and have looked at moisture/shear strength profiles informally, in undergraduate teaching settings.
