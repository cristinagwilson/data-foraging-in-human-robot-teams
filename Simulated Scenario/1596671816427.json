{"concludeQuestions":{"support":"Yes","confidence":"Slightly confident in my conclusion","improve":"I don't know enough about the saturation point for sand. The shear stress is increasing with moisture content, but I can't tell if the point when shear strength becomes constant is at, before, or after the saturation point because I don't know the saturation point of this sand. I don't think there is any experimentation I can do in this model to find that out. It might just be that I need to know more about moisture content and sand! I would assume saturated is 100% moisture content (all the pore spaces are filled) but then how can moisture content increase beyond saturation if that is the case. I suppose I just don't know enough about this topic. "},"isAlternativeHypo":false,"form":{"consistent":{"value":"Yes"},"evenly-space":{"value":"Yes"},"consistent-reason":{"value":"I chose 10 because I thought a robot could handle taking that many samples in a short time. But I wasn't sure of cost and time so didn't want to request more. I wanted enough to see the variability of the data. After 10 samples with a fair amount of scatter (and figure out that I could increase my sampling and not worry about cost or field time, I increased it to 100 samples. After seeing a similar spread of the data between 10 and 100 I could have reduced the number back down but didn't feel inclined to (or maybe I did, I already forgot) since time and money weren't an issue here. It seemed I could get the same quality with 10 samples as with 100. "},"evenly-space-reason":{"value":"I wasn't sure what the moisture profile of a dune looked like, so I just spaced them out thinking I could revise it after seeing the first few. I thought about decreasing the spacing lower in the dune because I thought the difference between the sampling points might be more extreme, but it didn't see to be the case. I suppose without worrying about time and money I could sample the whole dune at high resolution to really get a good view. But I got distracted by the fact that I wasn't sure I knew enough about saturation and moisture content - it seemed no amount of sampling in this way would help me evaluate the hypothesis because of my own lack of knowledge on the subject.
